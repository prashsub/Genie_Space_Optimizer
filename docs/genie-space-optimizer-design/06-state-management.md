## Overview

The optimizer maintains all state in Delta tables, providing ACID transactions, time travel, and schema evolution. State is partitioned by `run_id` (or `space_id` where appropriate), enabling concurrent runs on different spaces without conflict.

---

## Delta Tables

All tables are created in `{catalog}.{schema}` (configured via `GENIE_SPACE_OPTIMIZER_CATALOG` and `GENIE_SPACE_OPTIMIZER_SCHEMA` environment variables). Tables are created automatically on first use via `ensure_optimization_tables()`.

    [*] --> QUEUED: POST /optimize or /trigger
    QUEUED --> IN_PROGRESS: Job submitted
    IN_PROGRESS --> CONVERGED: All thresholds met
    IN_PROGRESS --> STALLED: No further improvement
    IN_PROGRESS --> MAX_ITERATIONS: Hit iteration limit
    IN_PROGRESS --> FAILED: Error or timeout

    CONVERGED --> APPLIED: User clicks Apply
    CONVERGED --> DISCARDED: User clicks Discard
    STALLED --> APPLIED: User clicks Apply
    STALLED --> DISCARDED: User clicks Discard
    MAX_ITERATIONS --> APPLIED: User clicks Apply
    MAX_ITERATIONS --> DISCARDED: User clicks Discard

    APPLIED --> [*]
    DISCARDED --> [*]
    FAILED --> [*]
```

### Status Definitions

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `QUEUED` | Run created, job not yet submitted |
| `IN_PROGRESS` | Job running, pipeline executing |
| `CONVERGED` | All quality thresholds met |
| `STALLED` | Optimization attempted but couldn't improve further |
| `MAX_ITERATIONS` | Hit the iteration limit without meeting all thresholds |
| `FAILED` | Error during execution |
| `APPLIED` | User confirmed the optimized configuration |
| `DISCARDED` | User rolled back to the original configuration |

## Provenance Chain

The provenance system creates a traceable path from every patch back to the judge verdicts that motivated it:

```
Judge verdict (ASI) --> Failure cluster --> Strategy action group --> Proposal --> Patch --> Gate result
```

This is queryable via the `genie_opt_provenance` table and visualized in the UI's Provenance Panel.

---

## Data Access

### Reading State

The backend reads state via `state.load_run()`, `state.load_stages()`, `state.load_iterations()`, `state.load_patches()`. These use `delta_helpers.read_table()` which handles:
- Schema change errors (`SCHEMA_CHANGE_SINCE_ANALYSIS`) with automatic `REFRESH TABLE` retry
- NaN/Inf scrubbing via `_scrub_nan()`
- Partition pruning on `run_id`

### Writing State

State writes use `state.create_run()`, `state.update_run_status()`, `state.write_stage()`, `state.write_iteration()`, `state.write_patch()`. These append to Delta tables with automatic schema evolution.
